# WP10_Cluster2_TransformerClassification

This repository aims to show Austria's use of text classification of ISCO codes model, based on a transformer model trained from scratch.

The main file `ISCO_BuildModel.R` will sequentially call all other scripts and files stored in the `/R` and `/data` folders. It is a fully runable example by using example data loaded in the `R/load_data.R` script. In the script, some synthetic auxiliary variables are added, these are optional.
